## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For CSS preprocessor
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

While developing this project, i learn how to get the user input in "realtime" (meaningly, as the user types) while calculating and displaying in the user interface the total value. I use the "keyup" event to get what the user types in the input field.

### Continued development

After i finish this project, i notice that i still need to perfect my style of coding in JavaScript, bacause i believe that there is other efficient way of getting the user input from the input field using JavaScript.
